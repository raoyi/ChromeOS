    same voltage rail for the SPI VREF as is does for the WP signal, and the SPI
    is on the 1.8V rail. For most transitors a 1.8V signal will be more than the
    Vgs threshold on the transitor, so it will be considered a logic high. All
    of the transistors for WP circuitry need to work with 1.8V signal for logic
    high. -->
