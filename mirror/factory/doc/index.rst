About this documentation
========================

This documentation is generated with the `Sphinx documentation builder
<http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_ from reStructuredText source files in the
doc directory in the factory software repository.

To build HTML documentation, run ``make doc`` in the factory
repository.  This will generate HTML documentation in the
``build/doc/html`` directory.  A documentation tarball is also
available as ``doc.tar.bz2`` in factory bundles.
