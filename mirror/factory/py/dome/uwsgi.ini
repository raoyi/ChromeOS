# made a change to bundle A, Dome stages the Umpire config, tries to update, and
# deploy. If we tried to make a change to bundle B before task A finishes, task
# B won't be able to stage the config since it's already staged, thus, task B
# will definitely fail. We can implement a synchronization mechanism in the
