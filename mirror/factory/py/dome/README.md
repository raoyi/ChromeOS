# Dome User Guide

Dome: The Factory Server Management Console

## Introduction to Dome

Dome is our new factory management console. On the factory server side, we have
different projects responsible for different parts before: Shopfloor, Umpire,
DKPS, Instalog, etc. They all have their own ways to manage, and require
knowledge of the command line interface. Therefore, Dome was born: management
console for all things in just one place, and best of all, it's GUI. In the
future, you no longer need to set up Shopfloor, Umpire, or Instalog
independently. You set up Dome, and let Dome help you finish all the tasks for
you.

## Prerequisite

1. You need [Docker](http://docker.io) installed on the target computer. Read
   [Factory Server](../../setup/FACTORY_SERVER.md#Prerequisite) for more
   details.

2. Dome is a web-based program, if you want to use it on the same Linux
   machine running Dome, youâ€™ll need the desktop environment. Run following
   commands to install the desktop environment and Chromium browser:

   ```shell
   sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop chromium-browser
   ```

## Installation

Dome is one of the component bundled in Chrome OS Factory Server package, so
please follow the steps in
[Factory Server](../../setup/FACTORY_SERVER.md#Installation) to deploy and
install Dome.

### Access Dome Web User Interface

Open your browser to port 8000 of the Dome server, and you should see the
welcome page. For example, if you're using the same machine and had the desktop
environment set up, open the browser to `http://localhost:8000`.

The default login credential is `admin / test0000`. The password can be
changed by running command `./cros_docker.sh passwd`.

*** note
**Note**: using Chrome/Chromium is highly recommended. If you want to use other
browsers such as Firefox, you'll have to make sure the timeout setting is long
enough or you're likely to get an timeout error when uploading bundle files
since they're normally very large.
