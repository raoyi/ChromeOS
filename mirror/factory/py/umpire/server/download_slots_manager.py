"""Handles /webapps/download_slots requests.

According to DUT (device under test) info embedded in request header, either it
will assign a new UUID to present a unique session if no uuid cookie presented
or keep a session alive mapped from the UUID in cookie. On the other hand, one
more information - N_PLACE will be returned which indicates whether the DUT gets
available download session (N_PLACE: 0) or been put in the queue due to slots
are all occupied already (ex: "N_PLACE: 3" shows that two DUTs are waiting for
the slot in front of it). In the end, the cookie of drop_slot would indicate
that this session is done so the slot can be reclaimed for other session.

  """Download Slots Manager

  DownloadSlotsManager is responsible for keeping a fixed number of DUTs can get
  the slot. And only DUTs got slots can start to download resources from factory
  server.

  This class will also monitor whether there are any slots owned by dead DUTs so
  we can prevent slots from always being occupied. This is achieved by asking
  DUTs to send heartbeat constantly in order to keep it's own slot alive.

  Properties:
    slots: A dict to record slots allocated status. The key is UUID and the
           value is timestamp when requested or re-newed by heartbeat.
    wait_queue: If all slots are occupied already then DUTs requesting slots
                would be put into this OrderedDict and once available slot is
                released the DUT in head of OrderedDict will have priority to
                own.
    delayed_call: An object works as a timer in order to check expired slots.
    max_slots_num: The maximum slots number is defined to limit how many DUTs
                   can download resources in parallel.
